# Automated-Detection-of-Electrical-Onset-of-Epileptic-Seizures-in-EEG-Data

Abstract—Epileptic seizures are sudden and unpredictable
events that can significantly impact the quality of life of individuals
with epilepsy. Early detection of seizure onset plays
a crucial role in providing timely interventions and improving
patient outcomes. In this project, we aimed to develop a machinelearning
model capable of detecting the onset of epileptic seizures
using electroencephalogram (EEG) data. The proposed approach
involves a combination of ensemble learning and regression
techniques. For the classification task, a voting ensemble model
was utilized, and for the Onset Detection, a CatBoost Regressor.
The main challenge encountered during this project was to
achieve accurate seizure predictions. Epileptic seizures are highly
diverse and complex. It is shown that the length of the segment
used for Seizure Detection has a decisive influence. Furthermore,
when using an ensemble method, great importance should be
attached to maximizing the diversity of the base estimators.
